                "message": "STARTUP INDIA- Here's a look at the most innovative and skyrocketing idea from the Indian Prime Minister.. \n\nOn the last Independence Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had introduced the Start-up India, Stand Up India' initiative.\n\nOn January 16, Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled a 19-point action plan for start-up enterprises in India. He also announced a self-certification scheme related to nine labour and environment laws. He also said that there would be no inspection of the enterprises during the first three years of the launch.\n\nModi has announced an all-inclusive action plan to boost such ventures that would boost employment generation and wealth creation.\n\nHere are the 19 plans Modi has for start-ups:\n\n1. Self certification\n\nThe start-ups will adopt self-certification to reduce the regulatory liabilities. The self-certification will apply to laws including payment of gratuity, labour contract, provident fund management, water and air pollution acts.\n\n2. Start-up India hub\n\nAn all-India hub will be created as a single contact point for start-up foundations in India, which will help the entrepreneurs to exchange knowledge and access financial aid.\n\n3. Register through app\n\nAn online portal, in the shape of a mobile application, will be launched to help start-up founders to easily register. The app is scheduled to be launched on April 1.\n\n4. Patent protection\n\nA fast-track system for patent examination at lower costs is being conceptualised by the central government. The system will promote awareness and adoption of the Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) by the start-up foundations.\n\n5. Rs 10,000 crore fund\n\nThe government will develop a fund with an initial corpus of Rs 2,500 crore and a total corpus of Rs 10,000 crore over four years, to support upcoming start-up enterprises. The Life Insurance Corporation of India will play a major role in developing this corpus. A committee of private professionals selected from the start-up industry will manage the fund.\n\n6. National Credit Guarantee Trust Company\n\nA National Credit Guarantee Trust Company (NCGTC) is being conceptualised with a budget of Rs 500 crore per year for the next four years to support the flow of funds to start-ups.\n\n7. No Capital Gains Tax\n\nAt present, investments by venture capital funds are exempt from the Capital Gains Tax. The same policy is being implemented on primary-level investments in start-ups.\n\n8. No Income Tax for three years\n\nStart-ups would not pay Income Tax for three years. This policy would revolutionise the pace with which start-ups would grow in the future.\n\n9. Tax exemption for investments of higher value\n\nIn case of an investment of higher value than the market price, it will be exempt from paying tax\n\n10. Building entrepreneurs\n\nInnovation-related study plans for students in over 5 lakh schools. Besides, there will also be an annual incubator grand challenge to develop world class incubators.\n\n11. Atal Innovation Mission\n\nThe Atal Innovation Mission will be launched to boost innovation and encourage talented youths.\n\n12. Setting up incubators\n\nA private-public partnership model is being considered for 35 new incubators and 31 innovation centres at national institutes.\n\n13. Research parks\n\nThe government plans to set up seven new research parks, including six in the Indian Institute of Technology campuses and one in the Indian Institute of Science campus, with an investment of Rs 100 crore each.\n\n14. Entrepreneurship in biotechnology\n\nThe government will further establish five new biotech clusters, 50 new bio incubators, 150 technology transfer offices and 20 bio-connect offices in the country.\n\n15. Dedicated programmes in schools\n\nThe government will introduce innovation-related programems for students in over 5 lakh schools.\n\n16. Legal support\n\nA panel of facilitators will provide legal support and assistance in submitting patent applications and other official documents.\n\n17. Rebate\n\nA rebate amount of 80 percent of the total value will be provided to the entrepreneurs on filing patent applications.\n\n18. Easy rules\n\nNorms of public procurement and rules of trading have been simplified for the start-ups.\n\n19. Faster exit\n\nIf a start-up fails, the government will also assist the entrepreneurs to find suitable solutions for their problems. If they fail again, the government will provide an easy way out."

The group \napproves projects and allots funds for them.\n\nThe Ministry of Human Resource Development(HRD), the Ministry of Defence,the Department of Science & Technology, the Department of Biotechnology, and the Ministry of Rural Development, among others, are part of 'Imprint India.'\n\nThe group has been set up to be a one-stop funding shop because many scientists and researchers said that bureaucracy was delaying projects and discouraging institutes from starting them. The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs)and the National Institutes of Technology are on board with the project that is being piloted by the Smriti Irani-led HRD ministry. \n\nThe group has identified 10 areas where India is heavily dependent on foreign technology and where little or no research and manufacturing has been initiated. These include healthcare, computers & information technology, energy, sustainable habitat, nano technology hardware, water resources and river systems, advanced materials, manufacturing, defence and environment and climate change.\n\nThe IITs and the Indian Institutes of Science have helped identify these areas and have detailed the specifics of India's technology requirements for the next few years. For instance, in areas like nano technology hardware and diagnostic imaging in healthcare, almost everything is imported. The research areas will also dovetail with the 'Make in India' campaign to boost indigenous manufacture.\n\n\"The idea is to encourage a research environment and also drive institutes to take up research that is socially and technically relevant to India's needs across sectors. For instance, in Healthcare, India practically imports every single diagnostic machinery simply because it is not manufactured here and there is new research in India which can be scaled up. Through IMPRINT, we hope to change that,\" said an official associated with Imprint."

                "message": "~~~~~~Google has a new \"LOGO\"!!! Change is part of nature.. Truly said. I guess that's why the most successful company in the world does amazingly stunning things to stupefy us!~~~~~~\n\nGoogle is introducing a new logo today. Just a month after unveiling a major restructuring of the company, Google is updating its image, too. The new Google logo is still a word mark, but it's now using a sans-serif typeface, making it look a lot more modern and playful. The colours are also softer than they used to be. The logo bears a bit more resemblance to the logo of Google's new parent company, Alphabet, as well. Alphabet's wordmark has a similarly unadorned look, and this update makes the two companies' design language fall more inline.\n\nAs Google's video introducing the new logo notes, the wordmark has been evolving ever since it was created in 1998. But this is easily its biggest change since 1999, when Google first cleaned up the lettering and settled on its four colours. Since then, the logo has just been flattened out more and more, with today's update representing a huge leap. In addition to changing up the wordmark, Google is also changing the tiny \"g\" logo that you see on browser tabs. It's now going to be an uppercase \"G\" that's striped in all four of Google's colours. Google says that the new design will be rolling out across all of its products soon \u2014 in fact, it's already on Google's homepage, with a cute animation that wipes away the old logo and draws in the new one.\n\nSo why did Google decide to make the change? In a blog post, Google discusses how much technology has changed how we interact with its products and with the internet at large. It doesn't really settle on a specific reason that a redesign was needed, but it says that this logo should better reflect the reality that Google is no longer a site you visit on a desktop computer \u2014 it's a huge collection of sites, apps, and services that you visit on PCs, Chromebooks, smartphones, and anywhere you can find a web browser. Google writes that its new logo is meant to reflect \"this reality and [show] you when the Google magic is working for you, even on the tiniest screens.\"\n\nMaking the logo look good on small screens seems to have been a major consideration. The new, simpler lettering is supposed to scale better to smaller sizes, making the wordmark more distinct and easier to read. It's also supposed to be easier for Google to display on low-bandwidth connections: Google says that it's made a version of its logo that's \"only 305 bytes, compared to our existing logo at ~14,000 bytes.\" Given that one of new Google CEO Sundar Pichai's big goals is to bring the internet \u2014 and Google, of course \u2014 to areas of the globe that don't already have it, that small difference is definitely going to be an important one."

Also, it the next update of the OS will be numbered Android 6.0, instead of Android 5.2 as previously speculated.\n\nAnnounced at Google I/O 2015, Android Marshmallow brings with it a number of new features to spruce up your smartphones and tablets (provided they get the update). Here\u2019s a look at 10 of the features you can look forward to with the next build of Android\u2026\n\n1. Google now on tap\nOne of the key Android Marshmallow features is Google Now on Tap, a more advanced version of the company's digital assistant. While Google Now is presently available, on most phones, only via the Search app, Android 6.0 will make it all-pervasive.\nThis means that you will be able to pull up Google Now to make a quick search across any app while using the smartphone. \n\n2. Chrome Custom Tabs\nMany a times, you click a link in an app and it either takes you to the default browser (like Chrome, Opera etc) or opens the link on the in-app browser. With Android 6.0, app makers will be able to integrate Chrome tabs into their apps, but retain the app\u2019s customized look. The toolbar colour, enter & exit animations, and custom actions as well as overflow menu can be picked by the app makers even if the link is of an external website.\n\n3. Battery life enhancements\nWhile Android Lollipop\u2019s Project Volta did not bring as much battery life improvement as was promised by Google, the company claims to have brought a fix with Android Marshmallow\u2019s Doze feature. Basically, this feature is said to bring your smartphone to a near-off state when it has been idle for a long time. \nIn Google\u2019s tests, Android 6.0\u2019s Doze resulted in two times the battery life compared to Android 5.0 on the same device with the same apps.\n\n4. Fingerprint support\nWhile many manufacturers, like Samsung, HTC, OnePlus, Oppo etc, have been using fingerprint sensors in their smartphones for quite some time, Google is making fingerprint sensor support native with Android 6.0.\nThis will not only add a new security layer to all smartphones (if manufacturers want to add this feature, that is) but also allow payment authentication via Android Pay.\n\n5. USB type C and faster charging\nGoogle is doing away with micro USB as the standard for the Android smartphones with the Android Marshmallow update, replacing it with USB Type C.\nThis relatively new USB type is backwards-compatible, which means that (like Apple\u2019s Lightning adapter) the charging cable can be inserted in the port either way, making it a convenience for all users.\nUSB Type C has two other advantages: It allows for faster data transfer rates and charges devices faster. In fact, Google says USB Type C can charge products up to 3-5 times faster than the current crop of micro USB chargers.\n\n6. App permissions\nGoogle has rebooted app permissions with Android 6.0. Marshmallow will allow users to accept or deny permissions to apps as when they are updated; for example, if an app you download wants to access your camera, you can choose to deny to that requirement while approving the others.\nThis is different from the current setup, where you must accept all permissions if you want to download an app.\n\n7. Android pay\nAndroid 6.0 Marshmallow will bring in Android Pay, an NFC-based payment system that will rival Apple Pay and Samsung Pay.\nThough it will be launched with Android Marshmallow, it will still be available for devices running on Android 4.4 and above.\n\n8. Direct Share\nSharing on Android is already pretty convenient, but Google is trying to make it easier with Android 6.0 Marshmallow with it a new feature called Direct Share.\nThough a lot is not known about this feature yet, we know that Direct Share will enable apps to share content (for example images) to specific contacts with just one click.\n\n9. New Boot Animation\nSharing on Android is already pretty convenient, but Google is trying to make it easier with Android 6.0 Marshmallow with it a new feature called Direct Share.\nThough a lot is not known about this feature yet, we know that Direct Share will enable apps to share content (for example images) to specific contacts with just one click.\n\n10. Customizable Toggles\nWhile most custom Android skins allow users to personalize the toggles in the notifications drawer, it is still not a native feature for Google\u2019s mobile operating system.\nThat is, however, about to change with Android Marshmallow, as users will be able to customize the toggles they want on Nexus devices as well (along with any other smartphone that runs on the stock version of Android 6.0)."

From Gayle\u2019s swashbuckling knock to Guptill\u2019s record world cup score, from Sangakkara\u2019s four centuries on the trot to some fine Indian bowling, from some deathly bowling of Starc to the spectacular drives of AB, this world cup was nothing but entertainment for cricket lovers. \nTechnology played an equal amount of role in making this world cup a huge success. \nIn a closely-contested cricket World Cup, any wrong decision by the umpire can turn an entire nation against him. But when in doubt, the game places its trust in technology. Here's looking at a slew of tech advances that have made cricket all the more worth watching:\n1). LED stumps and bails\n\nStump cameras are passé. LED stumps were the latest additions to the game.\n\nThe LED light flashes only when the bail is completely dislodged from the stumps which means the third umpire can get a clear view whether the bails are dislodged completely or not while making a decision.\n2). Real-time Snicko\n\nCommonly known as Snicko, this is used in televised cricket to graphically analyse sound and video as a ball passes a bat.\n\nIn use in various forms since 2008, it is one of the trusted go to technologies in the Decision Review System (DRS) in world cricket today.\n3). Pitch Vision\n\nIf you have seen television analysis pinpointing where each delivery landed on the pitch or your favourite batsman's performance on deliveries with different pace, line and length, thank Pitch Vision. It helps bowlers and batsmen statistically break down their performances.\n\nFor the first time in ICC World Cup, the LED stumps were introduced in the game.\n4). Spidercam\n\nThis is a new toy that cricket broadcasters set up for a bird's eye view of the game.\nIt enables a camera to move both horizontally and vertically over its flying area connected by cables, along the cricket pitch and the ground.\n\n5). Ball Spin RPM\nThe Ball Spin RPM (Revolution per Minute) demonstrates how fast a ball is spinning after it is released from the hand of a spin bowler.\n\nThe result: We almost instantaneously get the rotational speed of ball on the TV screen."

One example is that young developers tend to encounter out of memory problem in Java before even understanding how Java processes its memory.

( Oops! I hope you're not that person ;) )\n\nWe found a good blog that explained Why heap Space and Perm Gen. out of memory problem occurs.\n\nAnd what's interesting is they called it Young Generation memory and Old Generation memory. It's a quick read blog, so take time to read if you have encountered the problem and has no idea why it exactly happened. :)\n\n~Jai"

For a starting company, iOSS has faced many challenges regarding ERP implementations, nevertheless, this does not stop us from pursuing excellence.\n\nBelow is just one post of this consultant firm that says ERP implementation is never easy.\n\nBelow are some snippets from the blog post:\n\n>>When an ERP initiative led by a high-profile and well-respected ERP implementer occurs \u2013 as is the case in most high-provide failures \u2013 it proves the humbling facts that ERP implementations are by nature difficult. Anyone who suggests otherwise is either in denial or doesn\u2019t know what they are doing. \n\n>>After all, just as open heart surgery has plenty of examples of patients that haven\u2019t made it through alive, so too is the case with ERP implementations. (By the way, implementing new ERP systems is very similar to open heart surgery, in that it involves ripping out and replacing the \u201cguts\u201d of an organization.)\n\n>>Good ERP consultants may be few and far between but those that are good at what they do are able to learn from their own mistakes and failures.\n\n>>Those that don\u2019t have a few battle wounds under the belt are oftentimes dangerously naïve, which is the case with many of our competitors.\n\nPosted by: Jai"
