                "message": "Dear Team Kirkstall - an update and thanks for 4 weeks of incredible work\n\nWe are in phase two of the cleanup & rebuild - please read and SHARE SHARE SHARE so folk can find out how to get involved, as we still need help to see this cleanup through and make the success a lasting story. \n\nIt's still not a month since Kirkstall flooded and local people sprang into action in what has been hailed as an incredible success story by the everybody who has witnessed your awesome efforts during this cleanup.\n\nSince opening the volunteer centre we have registered over 500 volunteers through the volunteer centre - with most folk returning again and again to help clean up Kirkstall road and get folk back on their feet as quickly as possible.  Now we are focusing on getting the final few properties and businesses clearer out, and turning out attention wholeheartedly on the rebuild, to help get Kirkstall back to its former glory before spring. \n\nThe volunteer centre at Open Source Arts is still open and this week we will be continuing to welcome volunteers, register them, kit them out and send them into the community to help those most in need. \n\nThe big projects for this week are the community assets like the Milford rugby club who need their changing rooms and communal areas cleaning out, the burley wood allotments whicvh have been covered in detritus and the banks of the river which are still needing a giant litter pick - much clearing of washed up rubbish remains to be done so please text the following numbers if you have time to spare - \n\nPhil - 07508543473\nLucy - 07989503814\nFreya - 07588547040\n\nlet us know your name (if you havent been in touch before) - as well as what days and times you are free so we can schedule in groups and plan where they will go. \n\nthere are lots more ways for folk to get involved if you don't fancy getting mucky with manual work - here are some of the things we also need: \n\nAdministrators and Telephone helpers - \n\nBoth to manage the volunteer desk at Open Source Arts and also to help with the MAMMOTH task of phoning round all the businesses and donors who have pledged help which now need following up and turning into actual delivered donations!  folk have been very kind but memory fades and we need folk to help with phoning up to finalise the offers and schedule in times for the kind donations of building materials and rebuild stock to be delivered to our temporary storage warehouse which has kindly been donated by Simon at Cardigan Mills trading estate -  which ushers in the next role:\n\nWe need Van drivers or folk with estate cars - \n\nTo help with the collection and transportation of donations to the new storage space - as well as helping take some of the domestic donations to partner charities like Yorkshire Aid, who are ready now to accept our surplus donations of clothes and household kit.  they are going to take responsibility for disseminating those surplus donations to either homeless people or refugee and asylum seekers who REALLY need them right now.  all donations which folk have kindly given will get to people who really need them - even if they dont go to folk directly affected by the flooding. \n\nWe need Film Crew!\n\nAll this week we have had film crews out on Kirkstall Rd gathering footage and recording the story of the price this community has paid to the flood water - ensuring that as the media ceases to cover the story the true extent is not forgotten.  Folk are still working tirelessly to rebuild their livelihoods and we want to make sure the story of their efforts are heard not just locally but also by the decision makers down at the end of the M1 - so PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE if you have  passion for tech and want to get handy with a camera taking video or still photos, or if you are an emotionally intelligent person who can ask the right questions to make people feel safe to tell their story fully for the camera, please get in touch on the numbers above.\n\nWe have already collected a great deal of footage which will be hitting the new Kirkstall Cleanup YouTube channel this coming week - but beyond that, we want to collect sufficient footage over a prolonged period of time to create a feature length documentary showing the full story to those who need to know (and those who want to learn). Please get involved.\n\nWe need passionate community organisers to join our events committee\n\nSpringing from this incredible story, a story built of your outstanding donations of time and energy is a growing legacy for Kirkstall - and we will shortly be rebranding to Team Kirkstall and this means a great excuse for parties, celebrations, events and meetings within this outstanding community.  \n\nWe are appealing for people of all ages to join the events committee to help us create events for the whole community - starting with a MASSIVE THANK YOU PARTY - to celebrate the work everybody has put in. \n\nThis is only the beginning, and we are gathering momentum.  We want to create regular opportunities for everybody from this outstanding community to come together to celebrate the skills, talents and eccentricities native in the area - and find new ways to share ideas about how to make the community stronger, more resilient, quicker to organise and more able to make it's wishes heard and dreams come true for the people who live here.  Please come and join us to build the community you want to live in. \n\nWe need folk willing to join the response team - \n\nFollowing on from this cleanup we have been given a shipping container which we will store the response kit in - and working in partnership with The Environment Agency and Leeds City Council we will be running a programme of workshops for folk wishing to learn the volunteer management skills and the flood response skills necessary to respond quickly when something like this (not specifically as flood event, but anything which necessitates the community to rally around) happens in the future.  if you want to be a flood warden or general community responder, watch this space for information on how you can join the team, get skilled up and be on call for when we might have to dust off the head torches and brooms in the future.  \n\nThe hunt for tradespeople continues:\n\nThis is your opportunity to dig deep into your contacts list and think of a willing tradesperson who you think might want to donate some of their time to help the worst affected folk rebuild their livelihoods quickly - we want you to tag plumbers, electricians, builders, plasterers, tilers, joiners and landscapers who can donate a day of their time to the tradesperson timebank - lets rebuild kirkstall in style.\n\nThis is all creating a wonderful tapestry, one which is echoing through Leeds and teaching subtle lessons to many about how a community can come together in its time of need - so lets take it to the next level and make the story a lasting, vibrant legacy by seeing this through in true Team Kirkstall style.  \n\nSo, if you feel like you have time, we definitely have a way for you to get involved - please get in touch on the numbers above and SHARE SHARE SHARE and TAG anyone who you think could give their skills and time to this effort - so that when we ge tto the thank you party we all have something to thank each other for. \n\nThank you all for the time, energy, enthusiasm and dedication \n\nEach and every person who has dedicated time is an inspiration and I thank you from the depths of my flood riddled existence. \n\nLooking forward to what is to come, \n\nThank you!\n\nPhil"

                "message": "Dear Team Kirkstall - Exciting news about the video diary project - please Read and SHARE SHARE SHARE!\n\nI've had a couple of interesting conversations today with Craig and Lucas (two experienced filmmakers) and we have augmented the plan for how to make the video diary / documentary.\n\nThis means that as well as having a diary room set up in the volunteer centre at open source arts, we are also going to skill up any volunteers who want to help go out into the community to record the community stories.\n\nIn order to do this, Craig will be running 2 x \"how to shoot, edit and upload a short video\" at the workshop on Tuesday - for ALL VOLUNTEERS wishing to learn how to make a short video.  This is a great opportunity for volunteers to skill up and learn how to shoot a short video, edit it add credits and music and upload it to youtube all on an ipad - from a really skilled teacher who typically teaches professional television journalists how to make similar videos for news programmes. \n\nTo book your place on this training course reply below, they will be running on Tuesday 12th January - one at 12 noon and one at 1.30pm. 10 places per course.\n\nThe footage which our roving volunteer film makers collect will be uploaded directly to a new youtube channel so we can start to record the true emotional component behind this flooding, how it has affected people on a personal level. \n\nThe videos will be used to tell the true stories to decision makers hundreds of miles away, to help the lobbying process to try and get Leeds prioritised for improvements to the flood defences and attempt to gain the proper amount of funding to help the community recover and become more resilient.  \n\nWhen all the stories are collated, we will edit them together into a feature length documentary which we will try and get into the Leeds International Film Festival in the autumn. \n\nHow cool would that be - Team Kirkstall in the film festival!!!! Let's get on it pronto and make it happen in the same way we've made this cleanup happen!\n\nPlease share this and tag anyone you think would be interested in learning to make these short films, learning how to interview for camera, learning how to edit video or learning how to put it all together into the feature length - this is going to be a project form the community, about the community, delivered by members of the community and therefore if you want to be involved, there is a job waiting for you - GET IN TOUCH NOW!\n\nThanks for all your dedication up to this point - now lets take the story to the people who need to hear it!\n\nPhil"

                "message": "Hello Team Kirkstall !!\n\nIn light of our EXCELLENT progress, we are changing the way we manage the volunteers so please read and SHARE SHARE SHARE this post so the message spreads. \n\nWhat an excellent week it's been! The continued influx of volunteers has seriously blown me away - and together we have been blasting through the jobs list - continuing to gut, clear, sort and de filth the businesses all along Kirkstall road. \n\nMost businesses have by this stage had the loss adjusters in from their insurance companies, so we can begin clearing out these final buildings - so we really feel like we are entering the home straight with the clearouts.  This means that if you have a business which has been affected and you need our help you have to get in touch swifty if you want a volunteer team to come down and help - as we will close the volunteer centre and stop appealing for volunteers when there are no more registered jobs to complete.  \n\nWith this in mind, we have modified the volunteer management system so that volunteers now need no longer turn up at 11am each morning for registering, but rather now we are booking people who want to help into a time-slot so they can be matched up with a waiting job!\n\nso, IF YOU WANT TO VOLUNTEER:\n\n1.  Text Lucy (07989 503814) or Freya (07588 547 040) and detail your availability on each day in the coming week - they will then reply with a what days and hours youve been slotted into.  \n2.  Come to the volunteer centre on the days/times youve been texted about and you will be allocated your jobs and kitted out - put in your team and then sent out to save the universe.  \n3.  come back, have a cuppa and hopefully get involved in our new video diary project (More info about that tomorrow) \n\nIt's fairly simple, but it means we are in stage two of the cleanup and it feels like we are making good headway.  Lets keep the momentum going so that we can really finish this job in style and start on the rebuilding effort earnestly.\n\nToday all the business owners on kirkstall road met with representatives from the council, including Racheal Reeves, Tom Rioirdan, Cllrs Lucinda Yeadon and John Illingworth, plus representatives from the environment agency, Leeds Economic Partnership, Association of British Insurers and the Leeds Chamber of Commerce. \n\nIt was a good meeting and hopefully folk felt heard, even if the offers of initial relief grants of £2500 are seemingly insignificant, the council would like to encourage everybody to apply and register the entire extent of their losses, so that the true cost of this event can be totalled up for the purposes of lobbying for better flood defences, going forward.\n\nThe meeting was successful in telling business owners what kinds of support were available form the council and making sure business owners knew how to apply.  \n\nFor anyone who has not received the forms of needs more information - the forms are in the documents section of the facebook group - please click the \"files\" section at the top of the page to access them.  \n\nWe are still calling out for TRADESPEOPLE who want to donate their time to the cleanup - please email the group if you'd like to sign up, and if you know someone who could donate their time, please tag them in this post so they get the opportunity to help out.  \n\nWe can offer exposure by us publicising your business or trading name via our web portals and social media, and by listing your information on our facebook page under contacts - and in return you can help us rebuild this community bigger and stronger than it was before! \n\nFinally, Open Source Arts are going to be doing a story collecting exercise for the next fortnight, and we want everybody who has been effected by the flooding to come and tell us their story - we will be opening a video diary room on monday and you can book a time slot to come and tell us your story by texting lucy/freya your availability and they reply with what slot you can come to the volunteer centre to record your story during.  \n\nIt's MEGA IMPORTANT to record the stories of everybody effected now, so that in one month, 6 months or 3 years... whatever time in the future, the true emotional story of this flooding continues to resonate with the people who make the decisions, and the effects are not forgotten - so PLEASE TELL US YOUR STORY.  \n\nWe want to hear from everybody involved, not only people who were involved in the cleanup - we want business owners, rescue services, the police, councillors, the fire brigade, council officers, residents, dog walkers, scrap metal collectors - EVERYBODY!  Come and tell us what it's been like for you so we can get the broadest picture possible and really tell the true story!\n\nThank you EVERYBODY once again, this story is unfolding to create a much broader story for the Kirkstall community and it really really feels like we have a golden opportunity to emerge from this as a well networked, vibrant, active community ready to act of it's own volition to create a stronger community.  \n\nYou're all inspirational, \n\nThank you so so much!  \n\nPhil and all the team at the volunteer centre"

                "message": "TUESDAY 6th JANUARY UPDATE\n\nDear Kirkstall Cleaners - what a day it's been.  Thank you all to everyone who has turned out so far along the way - and extra special thanks to everyone who has continued their enthusiasm and dedication to carry on volunteering their valuable time into the new year.  I know a lot of you have started back at work and life carries on, so for all the time you gave, THANK YOU SO MUCH!\n\nFor everyone else who is CONTINUING to come, day after day, you are responsible for a growing total of volunteer hours.  Since we opened the volunteer centre on 28th December, we have registered an astonishing total of over 400 new volunteers - which does not include any of the hundreds of volunteers who turned out in force in the first few days after the flooding initially hit.  \n\nFiguring very conservatively - we calculate that this equals at least 2500 Volunteer hours, but that only reckons that each person who came down each day has given three hours and most people have given SO MUCH MORE!  arriving at 10am to the volunteer centre and not leaving until well after dark!  It's AWESOME and INSPIRING! it's a staggering amount of time and has been instrumental in the success story that has been this #KirkstallCleanup  ! \n\nWe have had a great day today down the volunteer centre, at @Opensourcearts with 40 volunteers registering and heading out to get stuck in, mucking out and gutting dark cellars and finally getting an opportunity to clean and make things look right again.  \n\nOur long travelling volunteers, the guys form T2T (Tunnels 2 towers) came through again today, as well as helpers from international Aid response Team israAID. They have many an interesting story and THE BEST cardamom coffee - it's like rocket fuel which explains how they manage to crack on so swiftly amidst the seas of destruction.  \n\nThis volunteer effort is astounding and we are beginning to make sense of the struggle - the effort is entering its second phase and I am focusing all my energy on building a great database of trades professionals who are willing to donate one day of their time, which will then be brokered out to uninsured individuals and businesses to help them get their feet beneath them again.  \n\nSo if you are a carpenter / joiner, plumber, gas engineer, painter and decorator, landscaper, metal worker, electrician then PLEASE GET IN TOUCH or SHARE SHARE SHARE and TAG people who you know might be able to help out.  This is the link to the form that you should fill in to register your offers of help.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1rA_oMZN1w_WpTKOnijl1SQM-ptmj2KwrwzonpJkctv8/viewform \n\nPlease help us make this rebuild Kirkstall effort as successful as the cleanup Kirkstall effort.  \n\nin the next week we will be looking at local resilience provision - which means putting essential kit which we have sourced (sandbags, lighting, shovels, brushes etc.) into a shipping container and plonking it somewhere in Kirkstall locally so that local people can respond to significant floor risks quickly, on the ground, without waiting for the powers that be to get their act in gear!  \n\nWe will also be providing training for anyone interested on key things like laying out sand bags, mobilising volunteers etc. so - if you want to learn more, come in to find out about our plan and how you can become involved in the response phone tree.  \n\nTimeframes\n\nWe are going to be running the Volunteer centre here for the next fortnight, during which time we hope to have completed the cleanup and got businesses to the point where they are ready to start refitting and for the people living and working here to rebuild their lives.  \n\nWith this in mind, I'd really like to encourage all the businesses who have been affected to come to the meeting with the council at Viva Cuba this Friday at 9.30am -  it's an opportunity to ask any questions about the government flood relief programme which is being devised, and to find out how to apply.  It will also be an opportunity to register your needs for help and rebuild time - so please come and get all the help you can. \n\nWe are closing on Sunday to give our volunteers a day off, as they have been working flat out since day 1 and deserve a rest so the next week can be tackled enthusiastically and effectively.  \n\nTomorrow, Friday and Saturday we have lots of jobs still to complete, so volunteers are very much required - we need lifters, carriers, cleaners, donations sorters, cooks, van drivers, people who can use pressure washers, folk who want to do some admin and people to help run the sign in desk at the volunteer centre... so they're is most likely a job for you if you have even a couple of hours to spare - COME ON DOWN and get stuck into being park of #TeamKirkstall.\n\nThank you all, for everything we have achieved together in the last ten day, you are all inspirational and it's an absolute privilege to be co-creating this with you all. \n\nPhil"

                "message": "Good ladies and kind gentlefolk of Kirkstall, \n\nPlease SHARE SHARE SHARE - we have a lot left to do and volunteers are NEEDED!\n\nThis is the start of week two of our incredible #KirkstallCleanup operation - and thank you, each and every one for continuing day after day to work like human sized two legged donkeys with hands and feet to get this community back in action.\n\nWe have ushered in the new year, and I'm not just celebrating because its the new year, I'm celebrating because of the incredible movement of volunteers working together in good humoured unison that I've witnessed over the last week.\n\nEach day we have been working from the Volunteer centre at Open Source Arts - welcoming volunteers, registering them, kitting them out and sending them where they are needed - and our volunteers are reporting that the volunteering experience is an excellent one.  We have had many lovely comments about how well held, supported and looked after the volunteers feel, and how important this is to making the cleanup a swifter process.  Not all disasters have to feel disastrous until they have been completely dealt with - and this effort is testament to that - so THANK YOU ALL for your positivity and dedication!  You are the ones making this the massive success it is.\n\nToday we were on hand as the second wave of businesses returned from their christmas holidays and found the devastation caused by the floodwater - We have been helping them clean out all day and are expecting more requests for help over the coming week.  \n\nA lot of mucking out, a lot of damaged stock and a lot of sweeping and brushing and mopping - but together we can do it rapidly - so please like and share this post to make sure we can carry on this incredible volunteer effort right to the conclusion. \n\nWe are expanding our focus this week - and putting in place efforts to #RebuildKirkstall \n\nTherefore we want to hear form skilled tradespeople who are willing to donate one or more days of their time, which will be taken, compiled into a directory and then brokered out to the most needy residents and small traders who have no insurance and desperately need help to get their lives back on track.  so if you are a tradesperson, get in touch, or if you know a tradesperson who might give a day of their time, please TAG them in this post so they can get signed up and do their bit to help out.\n\nIf you want to get involved and help with the cleanup - come down to the volunteer centre at Open Source Arts and get registered, put in a team and kitted out to help finish the cleanup so we can start the rebuild in style.\n\nAn important date for all local traders is the meeting at 9.30am on Friday morning at Viva Cuba - so please SHARE this so business owners on Kirkstall can get themselves down to hear about what the council is saying about flood recovery for businesses on Kirkstall Road.\n\nThank you all once again for your time, enthusiasm, dedication, smiles, immunity to dampening of the spirit and all the terrible terrible jokes.\n\nSee you tomorrow and for the rest of the week \n\nPhil"

This is high time to understand and take the advantages of this excellent technology.\nSo, to get an idea about this Mind-boggling and cool technology, we would welcome all of you to our workshop on 3D Printing presentation-cum-demonstration Workshop in Association with National Students' Space Challenge, powered by Srijan Creations, A Kolkata based 3D Printing Institute.\n\nDate : 31st October, Saturday\nTime : 11 AM\nVenue : V4, Vikramshila"

L\u2019industrializzazione della mente (e nella mente) è un processo degli ultimi cento anni. E non può essere spiegato semplicemente attraverso l\u2019analisi delle sue tecnologie. Il termine, vago e poco preciso, dell\u2019industria culturale incarna un paradosso. La coscienza può essere indotta e riprodotta industrialmente, ma non può essere prodotta. È un prodotto sociale: la sua natura è nel dialogo. Nessun processo industriale può sostituire le persone che lo generano. L\u2019industria della mente non produce nulla, se non le dinamiche di infiltrazione e trasmissione necessarie alla formazione della percezione del possibile, desiderabile, preferibile: nella formazione della percezione di futuro\".\n\nhttp://www.chefuturo.it/2014/10/come-sopravvivere-alle-nuove-fabbriche-della-mente-proviamo-a-ripartire-dalla-scuola/"

Since the Internet is basically a vast constellation of networks that somehow interconnect to provide the relatively seamless communication of data, it seemed logical one could draw lines from one point to another. The visualization is a collection of programs that collectively output an image of every relationship of every network on the Internet.\n\nThe result was an award-winning representation of the Internet that now hangs in the Museum of Modern Art in NYC.\n\nThe idea turned into a 10+ year labor of love under the moniker of The Opte Project. The map has been used an icon of what the Internet looks like in hundreds of books, in movies, museums, office buildings, educational discussions, and countless publications. The map has also become a teaching tool, allowing people that are visual learners to quickly understand what the Internet and networking is about.\n\nThe images are released under a creative commons license, which allows anyone to use it for non-commercial purposes. For commercial use, there is a single one-time license fee which goes to support this project.\n\n-> http://www.opte.org"

Se il 48% del campione dei seniores, ad esempio, considera avere uno stipendio alto come il criterio più importante nella scelta dell\u2019impiego, solo l\u201911% dei millennials attribuisce a questo elemento un valore così elevato. Viceversa, avere un lavoro denso di significato, in cui ci si possa sentire realizzati, è una priorità assoluta per il 30% dei millennials, ma sta a cuore solo all\u201911% dei seniores. In generale, poi, i millennials sono nati nell\u2019era dell\u2019economia collaborativa e della condivisione, mentre l\u2019ideologia che ha accompagnato la crescita professionale dei seniores era basata su competizione e privilegi\".\n\nUn pezzo di Andrea Libero Carbone, via CheFare"

If you look at traditional societies (non-Western societies) across the globe, like the Hunza, the Eskimos, the Sioux, the Gaelics, the Aborigines, the Ma'asai, etc, these people are all optimally healthy. For traditional societies the world over certain animal foods are sacred and revered for bestowing fertility, health, and robustness. Such foods as organ meats of fish and game animals, fish eggs, cream, butter, cheese, raw milk, crustaceans, bone marrow, and other sea animals like whales and seals are deemed necessary by the people who use them for giving expecting mothers a trouble-free gestation and birth, and for allowing kids and children to grow into perfect adults. These people have perfect eyes, perfect teeth (including wisdom teeth), and generally perfect bodies; that is to say they are \"normal\" by nature's standards. Furthermore, they accredit physical perfection to these animal foods. \n\nWith permaculture and regenerative agriculture we can create and maintain environments for all our necessary foods, both plant and animal, and harvest sustainably."

                "message": "Long post, some thoughts on the text of SB 539 Regulation of e-liquid\n\n> \"Tobacco product\", for purposes of IC 7.1-3-18.5, means a product that\n> (1) contains tobacco, including e-liquid (as defined by IC 7.1-7-2-8); and\n> (2) is intended for human consumption\n\nthen\n>Sec. 8. \"E-liquid\" means a substance that is:\n>(1) intended to be vaporized and inhaled using a vapor pen; and\n>(2) manufatured and sold in a refillable or unsealed container or any container larger than two (2) milliliters \n\nSo you can mix the juice for cigalikes in a port-a-potty.\n\nPermits will be accepted and issued until June 30, 2016.  A manufacturing permit is valid for 5 years.  Applications must include plans for construction and operation and demonstrate that the facility is\n\n>(A) consistent with reasonable guidelines regarding clean room facilities and sterilization processes; and\n>(B) capable of meeting all of the security requirements contained in this article\n\nWe all want our juice to be mixed in a clean environment.  I support ISO-9 for mixing, as we want sterile surfaces and low dust, but ISO-6 is pharmaceutical level and I suspect what this language is probably leading to.  That's a $60,000 clean room.  It's what our nicotine vendors probably should have, it's what you need when you're doing real chemistry.  But for mixing, I believe food-safe is what we need, and that's an ISO-9 clean room.\n\nAll of the security requirements...  they're weird.  Pretty sure it's about preventing some legal synthetic weed juice from hitting the head shops, but I'm not convinced it will stop any of that.  Nobody in the vaping community would do that anyway.\n\n>(11) The manufacturer's security firm shall install a remotely monitored security system at the facility in areas where e-liquid is mixed, bottles, packaged, and stored.\n>(12) The manufacturer's security firm shall install an exclusive high security key system that limits access to areas where e-liquid is mixed, bottled, packaged, and stored to authorized personnel only.\n\nsounds kind of expensive, but I bet it's under $1500.\n\n>(13) The manufacturer's facility must be subject to twenty-four (24) hour video recording with remote viewing capability in areas where e-liquid is mixed, bogttled, packaged, and stored.  The video recordings must be retained for at least thirty (30) days.\n\nSounds more expensive, simply because the remote monitoring and logging is an ongoing part of the service contract.  Pretty sure this is so the DEA can watch us to make sure we're not putting drugs in it.\n\n>(14) The manufacturer must take reasonable steps to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to secured areas of the facility where e-liquid is mixed, bottled, and packaged.\n\nSo that Guido doesn't sneak in to put drugs in it?  I don't know.\n\n>(15) The manufacturer must submit to random audits of the facility and the manufacturer's records by the commission.\n>(16) The manufacturer must submit to random site visits by the commission.\n\nIt would be better if it was a vaping-related regulatory agency instead of IN's Alcohol and Tobacco commission, but whatever, audits make sense.\n\n>(17) The manufacturer must own and control both the e-liquid manufacturing and bottling process.\n>(18) The manufacturer or anyone having a financial interest in a manufacturer may not have been convicted of a felony or an offense involving moral turpitude or a controlled substance.\n\nHehe, I just did a google image search for turpitude.\n\nThis bill also criminalizes selling eliquid in Indiana that is not approved by the Indiana Alcohol & Tobacco commission, meaning anyone that didn't file, meet the reqs, and pay the money.  Selling out of state juice, assuming it didn't have the Indiana license, would be a class B infraction, worse than selling to a minor (class C).  There has been speculation that this may make the bill unconstitutional under the interstate commerce clause."

Open Source Aquaponics supplied the fish and assorted plants to get the greenhouse green and the nitrogen cycling started asap.  \nFor the scope of the project and number of people involved it went remarkably well and I had the privilege of making new friends from all over the U.S.A. and Quebec Canada.  The people were by far my favorite part of the trip and I look forward to collaborating more with Marcin and others from the workshop."

Le low cost macinano un numero di prestazioni odontoiatriche che uno studio privato se le sogna. E lo fa in maniera costante da anni , nonostante che i colleghi fuori da questi circuito critichino e mettano\" ingiustificatamente \" in guardia i loro pazienti. Ciò che conta è la qualità percepita..... È questo non va assolutamente bene , perché non corrisponde alla qualità erogata !!! Le low cost hanno in funzione dei grandi numeri di prestazione una intera popolazione all'esterno di aventi goduto cure, e questa popolazione è' incontrollabile ,e racconta agli         altri  la sua esperienza che può essere negativa o positiva , ma non necessariamente perché lo è stata veramente ..... Ma solo perché le sue aspettative sono state esaudite o no!! Il peggio è che a fronte di un numero così elevato di pazienti trattati , spesso al bar , o alle poste , esiste l'alta probabilità che due persone si incontrino e si scambino la loro esperienza maturata nell'ambito della stessa struttura. E voi sapete che delle cose buone..... Percepite....... Si parla poco, delle cose cattive ..... Percepite, .....se ne parla molto , e questo amplifica la probabilità che di una struttura non se ne parli positivamente . Però , si c'è un però: nonostante queste dinamiche le strutture complesse non perdono i pazienti ..... Gli studi convenzionali invece si!!!! E sapete perché? Noi possiamo fare quello che vogliamo , inventarci ciò che ci pare ( front Office straordinarie, padiglioni grandi luminosi ed attrezzature le più moderne) ma il paziente decide in base sempre al suo percepito che è reale o falsato dalla sua cultura , psicologia , ma soprattutto dalla necessità di spendere il meno possibile. La professione e' stata consegnata nelle mani della gente comune , e questa fa ciò che vuole, a volte sembra che si abbia trovato il modo di incanalarla, ma dura poco. Il vero errore e mistificazione sta nel fatto che il cittadino è' stato bombardato e viene bombardato  sulla necessità delle cure odontoiatriche come se dovesse fare un vaccino obbligatoriamente ...... Ma alla fin fine purtroppo per molta gente, quando si profilano preventivi da affrontare sopra i mille euro , comincia ad entrare in difficoltà  e quindi cerca il risparmio.'mettiamocelo in testa il vero problema  è che tutti non possono o non vogliono affrontare certe spese. Quindi la dinamica della libera professione e' irreversibilmente compromessa: alti costi di esercizio , pletora di offerta, basso costo può anche significare bassa qualità..... Ma questo è più vero per lo studio tradizionale , quando cerca di adattarsi al mercato, che per le low cost . Buona giornata"
